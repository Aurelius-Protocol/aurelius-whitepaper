## Overview

Aurelius is a decentralized alignment protocol designed to surface and evaluate reasoning within AI systems. It introduces a multi-agent architecture of Miners, Validators, and the Tribunate to generate adversarial prompts, evaluate ethical reasoning, and synthesize collective judgment â€” forming the foundation of verifiable alignment.

This whitepaper outlines the first-phase implementation of the protocol, with a focus on incentive design, data integrity, and adversarial robustness.
